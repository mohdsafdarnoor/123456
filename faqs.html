    <!-- SECTION 1: ABOUT THE PLATFORM -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>🤖 About AI Tools</h2>
      
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">Is it cheating to use ChatGPT for my cover letter?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>No, but you must use it responsibly. German recruiters value authenticity. Use ChatGPT to create a structure, fix grammar, or brainstorm ideas, but <strong>always rewrite the final text</strong> in your own voice. Copy-pasting generic AI text is easily detected and often leads to rejection.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">Are these tools free to use?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Most tools listed in our directory (like ChatGPT, Canva, LinkedIn) have powerful <strong>free versions</strong> that are sufficient for students. Some specialized tools (like VMock or DeepL Pro) may have paid tiers, but we prioritized tools accessible to students.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">Can I use English prompts for German applications?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Yes! You can ask ChatGPT in English to write a cover letter in German. However, the quality is usually better if you give the context in English but ask it to "act as a German native speaker." Always have a native speaker or DeepL proofread the result.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 2: WORKING IN GERMANY -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>🇩🇪 Working in Germany</h2>
      
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">How many hours can I work as a student?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Non-EU students can work <strong>120 full days or 240 half days</strong> per year. During the semester, you can work up to <strong>20 hours per week</strong> (Werkstudent rule) to keep your student insurance status. During semester breaks, you can work full-time (40 hours).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">What is the difference between "Pflichtpraktikum" and "Freiwilliges Praktikum"?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pflichtpraktikum (Mandatory):</strong> Required by your study regulations. It is <em>exempt</em> from minimum wage (companies can pay €0, though many pay €500-1000). You don't pay social security.</li>
            <li><strong>Freiwilliges Praktikum (Voluntary):</strong> Not required. If it lasts longer than 3 months, you <em>must</em> be paid minimum wage (approx. €12.41/hour). You pay social security.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">Do I need C1 German to find a job?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Not always, but it helps significantly. In IT, Engineering, and some Business roles (Startups, MNCs), <strong>English</strong> is often sufficient (B2+). However, for traditional German companies (Mittelstand) or client-facing roles, <strong>B2/C1 German</strong> is usually required. We recommend reaching at least B1 to increase your opportunities.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <div class="accordion-header">What is a "Werkstudent" job?</div>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>A "Werkstudent" (Working Student) is a specific employment status for enrolled students. You work part-time (max 20h/week) in a company related to your studies. You pay reduced taxes and almost no social security contributions (only pension), leaving you with more net income than a regular part-time job.</p>
